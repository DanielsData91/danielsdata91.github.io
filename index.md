I’m a data analyst with a diverse background, open to relocation. Throughout my career, I’ve developed a strong ability to analyze client needs, create tailored solutions, and deliver insights that drive meaningful change.

This project aims to help a medical staffing agency plan for increased demand during the influenza season when hospitals and clinics require additional staff. By analyzing trends in influenza across the U.S., the goal is to proactively determine staffing needs for each state. The analysis will translate business requirements into actionable insights, ensuring the right number of temporary workers are sent to each location. While this project focuses on healthcare, the analytical approach can be applied to various industries.
