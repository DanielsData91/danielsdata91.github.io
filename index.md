<details>
  <summary>📁 Project Case Study 4: Brazil E-Commerce Analysis - Detailed Overview</summary>
  
  <h2 class="about-heading">1. Introduction</h2>

  <p><strong>The Challenge</strong><br>
  I conducted a detailed data analysis in Python to generate valuable insights that supported the marketing team in developing a Franchise Program.</p>

  <p><strong>The Process</strong><br>
  Utilized Python to explore and analyze multiple datasets, applying complex functions to assess marketing performance and answer critical business questions. Conducted insightful analyses to test hypotheses.</p>

  <p><strong>Goal</strong><br>
  Identified top-performing products by evaluating revenue, quantity sold, and average review scores. Assessed shipping performance and analyzed high-lifetime-value customers. These insights informed a data-driven approach to initiate the development of a Franchise Program in the western regions of Brazil.</p>

  <h2 class="about-heading">2. Hypothesis Testing</h2>
  <p>I began exploring the relationship between the variables to test my hypothesis. Early on, I noticed that there appeared to be a relationship; however, the nature of this relationship could not be fully captured through exploratory data analysis (EDA) alone. Therefore, I decided to apply a more advanced analytical approach—linear regression analysis—to better understand the relationship. Unfortunately, the regression model proved to be less suitable than expected for capturing the complexity of the data.</p>
  <p>Recognizing that a linear approach might not be sufficient, I took additional steps to uncover further insights. I turned to cluster analysis, which helped identify distinct patterns within the data. The clustering revealed groups of observations with different shipping behaviors, suggesting that the relationship between shipping days and shipping duration is not uniform across all data points. This segmentation provided valuable insights into different shipping performance categories, such as early deliveries, standard on-time shipments, and delayed orders. These insights could be leveraged to improve logistics processes and better manage customer expectations.
</p>

  <h3>Business Insights</h3>
<p>Understanding the difference between actual shipping arrival dates and estimated shipping dates provides valuable insights into shipping performance. It helps identify potential delays and ensures that delivery processes can be optimized. Additionally, locating high-lifetime-value customers allows businesses to uncover new potential sales regions. Identifying the most profitable product categories per order further supports efforts to enhance product performance in underdeveloped markets, such as the western regions of Brazil. This could present an.</p>
  <p>To uncover these insights, I conducted a detailed analysis using Python. This involved identifying the top product categories based on average revenue per order, evaluating shipping performance, and pinpointing customers with the highest lifetime value. These findings can guide data-driven decisions to optimize logistics, expand into new markets, and enhance product distribution strategies.
Does this version capture what you had in mind? Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
</p>

  <h2 class="about-heading">3. Challenges & Limitations</h2>
  <p>This analysis aimed to identify customer segments generating the highest revenue, essential for ad targeting. An exploratory data analysis grouped customers based on demographics, revealing age as a significant differentiator among high-value customers.</p>

  <h3>Challenge 1</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>One of the main challenges I faced was my initial expectation that the data would reveal a clear relationship between the variables, confirming my hypothesis. When this expected relationship did not emerge, it was difficult to accept that my hypothesis might not be supported.

I overcame this challenge by stepping back and reassessing my approach. I realized that not rejecting the null hypothesis is also a valuable result. It can indicate that the assumed relationship may not exist or may be more complex than anticipated. This understanding opened the door to further investigations, encouraging me to explore alternative factors and relationships within the data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Challenge 2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Another challenge was more technical. I found it difficult to recreate the same or similar visualizations in Tableau as I had initially produced in Python. Some custom plots and detailed adjustments were not as easily achievable in Tableau.

I resolved this by simplifying the visualizations in Tableau and focusing more on providing clear explanations and context. This approach ensured that my insights were still effectively communicated, even if the visual output differed from my Python work.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 class="about-heading">Project Case Study 1: Preparing for Influenza Season</h2>
<br><br>
<img src="images/Collage Case Study CDC.png"/>

<details>
  <summary>📁 Project Case Study 3: CDC / Preparing for Influenza Season - Detailed Overview</summary>
  
  <h2 class="about-heading">1. Introduction</h2>

  <p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
  Each year, the USA faces a challenging influenza season with rising infection rates, especially among the growing elderly population. To manage this effectively, staffing agencies must strategically allocate healthcare workers to hospitals in states projected to have the highest influenza-related mortality rates in the coming year.</p>

  <p><strong>Analysis Approach</strong><br>
  Used descriptive analysis to identify the most vulnerable groups and assess the demographic impact of influenza, highlighting high-risk populations. Mapped geographic regions with the highest mortality rates and identified seasonal patterns in influenza outbreaks to predict peak periods. Analyzed correlations between mortality rates and vulnerable population segments, enabling precise forecasting for effective resource allocation.</p>

  <p><strong>Targeted Distribution Strategy</strong><br>
  The objective was to pinpoint the U.S. regions most in need of support during the influenza season, ensuring optimal medical staff distribution for maximum impact. By forecasting high-risk areas and vulnerable populations, this approach supports efficient staffing decisions and improved preparedness for the upcoming influenza season.</p>

  <h2 class="about-heading">2. Approach - Staff Distribution</h2>

  <p><strong>WHO - Individuals over 65 years</strong><br>
  Conducted a descriptive analysis to quantify the composition of influenza-related mortality rates across age groups, revealing that individuals over 65 are most vulnerable—confirming key assumptions for the staffing agency. These findings allow the agency to prioritize resources and tailor staffing levels based on age-related risk.</p>

  <p><strong>WHERE - Southern Region of the USA</strong><br>
  By identifying geographic locations with concentrated populations of vulnerable individuals using geospatial analysis, the agency gains clear, data-backed guidance on where to allocate medical staff for the greatest impact. This insight enables strategic workforce deployment.</p>

  <p><strong>WHEN - November to April</strong><br>
